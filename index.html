				<h2>Quantum Chemistry</h2>
				<h3>The Basic Idea</h3>
				<p> All the theory that is give after newtons laws of motion is to explain may body systems in some way
					or the other. Quantum theory is also one of the approach to do such things. The prime reason for
					this theory to capture the concept of wave particle duality simultaneously. In a single mathematical
					equation. Its equations is comes from Hamiltonian mechanics. Hamiltonian mechanics could thought of
					as a mathematical model that trys to explain the motion of some though interacting with each other
					but immiscible fluids. This model does this thing very picularly. It does so by equating the energy
					descriptor of a quantity called wave function \(\Psi\) . Which is described as a quantity with no
					physical significance but when you square it ( \(\Psi^{2}\) ) you will get the probability of
					finding that particle in a given region. Although the quantity \(\Psi\) is not thought of as is
					prior to its derivation. It is the solution of the differntial equation that came out so that its
					explaination would be that. The differential equation is called Shordinger equation.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h3> Shordinger equation</h3>
				<h5> Time-independent Schrödinger equation </h5>
				<p>
					\[
					\left[\frac{-\hbar^{2}}{2m} \nabla^{2} + V (\mathbf{r})\right]
					\Psi(\mathbf{r}) = E\Psi(\mathbf{r})
					\]
					In most simple explaination of this equation is total energy \(E\)is equale to the sum of potential
					energy \(V (\mathbf{r})\) and kinetic energy \(\frac{ -\hbar^{2}}{2m} \nabla^{2} \). The fancy
					looking term is just similar term to square of velocity. In Chemistry mostly Time-independent
					Schrödinger equation to explain consistance properties of material. There are various case for which
					this equation is solved. Depending on the system one is studying. For chemists The most important
					system is Hydrogen atom. Also this is most complex system that can be solved compleatly. All the
					other system have just approximate solution based on Hydrogen atom solution.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h3> Hydrogen Atom</h3>
				<h5> Hydrogen atom Schrödinger equation </h5>
				<p>
					\[
					\left( -\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2\mu} \nabla^{2} - \frac{e^{2}}{4\pi \epsilon_{0} r}\right)
					\psi(\mathbf{r}) = E\psi(\mathbf{r})
					\]
				</p>
				<h5> Its solution is </h5>
				<p>
					\[
					\psi_{nlm}(r,\theta,\phi) =
					\sqrt{
					\left ( \frac{2}{na_{0}^{*}}\right)^{2}
					\frac{(n-l-1)!}{2n(n+l)!}
					}
					e^{-\rho/2}
					\rho^{l}
					L^{2l+1}_{n-l-1}(\rho)
					Y^{m}_{l}(\theta,\phi)
					\]
					where:
					\[
					\rho = \frac{2r}{na_{0}^{*}}
					\]
					\(
					L^{2l + 1}_{n-l-1}(\rho)
					\)is a generalized Laguerre polynomial of degree \( n-l-1\)<br>
					\( Y^{m}_{l}(\theta,\phi) \) is a spherical harmonic function of degree \(l\) and order
					\(m\).<br>
					In this solution we get 3 quantum number \(n,l,m\) ,which give rise various kind of functions
					describing all allowed wave function of electron that can exist in hydrogen. For solution further
					systems combination of these wave function is used.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h3> Hartree Fock Theory</h3>
				<h5> Hartree Fock equation </h5>
				<p>
					\[
					\hat{H} |\Psi \rangle = E | \Psi \rangle
					\]
					Hartree fock theory is the theory that used to solve multielectron system. It hold a number of
					approximation and techniqueue to describe multielectron system.
